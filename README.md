## Milestone 1
Milestone 1 had the task of creating a model on Teachable Machine to be able to recognise the difference between 4 classes: rock, paper, scissors & nothing.

Within the creation of this model, approximately 800 images was taken of my hand representing the 3 classes of rock, paper & scissors, with the last class consistenting of 800 images of 'nothing' present.
This will allow the model to correctly determine if the user of the program will be showing each of the four classes.
